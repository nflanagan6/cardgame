=== JUnit Platform Reporting

The `junit-platform-reporting` artifact contains `{TestExecutionListener}`
implementations that generate test reports. These listeners are typically used by IDEs
and build tools. The package `org.junit.platform.reporting.legacy.xml` currently contains
the following implementation.

* `{LegacyXmlReportGeneratingListener}` generates a separate XML report for each root in
  the `{TestPlan}`. Note that the generated XML format is compatible with the de facto
  standard for JUnit 4 based test reports that was made popular by the Ant build system.
  The `LegacyXmlReportGeneratingListener` is used by the
  <<running-tests-console-launcher>> as well.

NOTE: The `{junit-platform-launcher}` module also contains `TestExecutionListener`
implementations that can be used for reporting purposes. See <<running-tests-listeners>>
for details.
